    <u><h1>HÃ„UFIG GESTELLTE FRAGEN (FAQ)</h1></u>

    <h2 class="faq_question" style="margin-top: 30px;">
    1. There is no way I can learn all the articles to all the words. What are the rules?<br>
    </h2>
    <h2 class="faq_answer">A: First of all, you have to start believing in yourself. Second, 
    <a style="font-size: 18px; margin-left: 0px; color: black;" href="https://www.sprachschule-aktiv-muenchen.de/deutsche-artikel-lernen-regeln-und-erklaerung/l"><u>here</u></a> are some rules. 
    Unfortunately, there are quite a few of them and many nouns don't fall under any of those categories.
    </h2 class="faq_question">
    <h2 class="faq_question" style="margin-top: 30px;">
    2. Is this the right website for me to learn German from start to finish?<br>
    </h2>
    <h2 class="faq_answer">A: That's a dumb question so I'm glad you didn't ACTUALLY ask that. Absolutely not. As a matter of fact, I personally think that learning a language with any
    electrical device is a waste of time. However, I also think that repeating vocab using pieces of paper and a pen is 
    a waste of ressources. So clicking on stuff here is supposed to be merely complementary to a REAL class (also let's not get used to online-classes,
    please. I understand that during COVID-19 there's no other choice. Call me old-fashioned but I don't like this webcam-business).
    </h2 class="faq_question">
    <h2 class="faq_question" style="margin-top: 30px;">
    3. What's all this vocabulary? How do you decide what's A1, A2, and so on?<br>
    </h2>
    <h2 class="faq_answer">A: These nouns have been extracted from the "Motive" books. Some of them may repeat themselves or be reused as parts of
    other compound words, which I find to be a GOOD thing, since the goal here is to get a "feeling" for the correct article and not necessarily remember
    as many individual nouns as possible (which is also a good thing, though). But yeah, it's pretty arbitrary.
    </h2 class="faq_question">
    <h2 class="faq_question" style="margin-top: 30px;">
    4. How many words are there in each level?<br>
    </h2>
    <h2 class="faq_answer">A: Over 600. The sequence is random and doesn't end.
    </h2 class="faq_question">
    <h2 class="faq_question" style="margin-top: 30px;">
    5. How were you able to create such a magnificent website?<br>
    </h2>
    <h2 class="faq_answer">A: I watched html/css and JavaScript tutorials on Skillshare.com because the COVID-19 lockdown almost turned me into an alcoholic and so I had 
    to start doing something with my time. Thanks for the compliment by the way, I really appreciate it.
    </h2 class="faq_question">
    <h2 class="faq_question" style="margin-top: 30px;">
    6. This website really helped me learn all the articles to all the nouns! How could I repay your kindness? The "Send Me Money"-link is under construction.<br>
    </h2>
    <h2 class="faq_answer">A: That's really kind of you and don't think for a moment, I wouldn't accept your money. However, I don't yet know how to set up a donation thing
        and ads give me cancer so I guess I'm not going to be making any money with this website for now.
    </h2 class="faq_question">
    <h2 class="faq_question" style="margin-top: 30px;">
    7. Don't tell me you did all the artwork yourself too!<br>
    </h2>
    <h2 class="faq_answer">A: I absolutely did. I'm pretty talented, aren't I?
    </h2 class="faq_question">
    <h2 class="faq_question" style="margin-top: 30px;">
    8. Yes, you really are!<br>
    </h2>
    <h2 class="faq_answer">A: Aww thanks :). You're talented too!
    </h2 class="faq_question">
    <h2 class="faq_question" style="margin-top: 30px;">
    9. Do you want to get coffee some time?<br>
    </h2>
    <h2 class="faq_answer">A: Sure, when are you free?
    </h2 class="faq_question">
    <h2 class="faq_question" style="margin-top: 30px;">
    10. How about next friday? Grab a coffee, then go see a movie maybe?<br>
    </h2>
    <h2 class="faq_answer">A: I'm interested, how about we meet at 5 p.m. at Starbucks?
    </h2 class="faq_question">
    <h2 class="faq_question" style="margin-top: 30px;">
    10. Cool, see you then!<br>
    </h2>
    <h2 class="faq_answer">A: Bye :) <br><br>Man that was the best FAQ I've ever had.
